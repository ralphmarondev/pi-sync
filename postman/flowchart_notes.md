I get what you mean! Because the solenoid’s opening and closing affects the door—and the user sees that—it feels like output. But in flowchart terms, here’s the subtle difference:

Input/Output (Parallelogram): Used when the system is interacting with the outside world by receiving input (like pressing a button) or showing output (like displaying a message).

Process (Rectangle): Used for actions the system does internally—like turning the solenoid on or off to open/close the door.

So, opening/closing the solenoid itself is a process, because it’s an internal control operation—even if the result (the door opening) is visible to the user.

If you want to represent the user’s action, like pushing a button to open the door, that would be an input (parallelogram). And if you want to show the system displaying a message like “Door is open,” that would be an output (parallelogram).
